            <p>Hi! This is our first page, we hope you like our website! SZ </p>
            <p>For now it is just a chill place, but how knows?! Maybe soon it will have something cooler.</p>
            <p>What do you think about it? Let we know!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <h4 class="title">What you will found here</h4>
            <p>That website will have some experimentation with mostly Python and Flask</p>
            <p>But you will find some with HTML and CSS, like you are already seeing right now!</p>
            <p>This page uses display flex to have two collumns like if it were an good and old news paper.</p>
